## 🏢 Deloitte Australia – Data Analytics Job Simulation (Forage)

This project was completed during the **Deloitte Australia Data Analytics Job Simulation**, a virtual experience program designed to simulate real-world consulting tasks.

### During the simulation, I:
- Performed hands-on **data analysis**
- Worked with **forensic technology concepts**
- Used **Excel** to classify data and derive business conclusions
- Built **interactive dashboards in Tableau**
- Analyzed machine telemetry data to identify operational risks

📅 **Completion Date:** December 2025  
🏅 **Issued by:** Deloitte via Forage  

> This experience strengthened my analytical thinking, data storytelling, and problem-solving skills in a consulting-style environment.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Manufacturing downtime directly affects productivity and cost.  
This project focuses on identifying **where and why machine downtime occurs** using telemetry status data.

### Key Objectives:
- Measure downtime using unhealthy machine signals
- Compare downtime across **factories**
- Identify **high-risk device types**
- Provide actionable insights through visual analytics

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Tableau** – Data visualization & dashboards  
- **Excel** – Data inspection & classification  
- **CSV / JSON** – Telemetry data sources  

---

## 📂 Dataset Description

- **Source:** Daikibo Telemetry System  
- **Key Fields:**
  - Factory
  - Device Type
  - Machine Status (Healthy / Unhealthy)
  - Timestamp

📌 Each **Unhealthy** status represents **10 minutes of potential downtime**.

---

## 📐 Methodology

1. Imported telemetry data into Tableau  
2. Created a calculated field:
3. Aggregated downtime:
- By **Factory**
- By **Device Type**
4. Built bar charts for comparative analysis  
5. Combined visuals into a filter-enabled dashboard
